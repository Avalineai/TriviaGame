# TriviaGame

* You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 


* The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.


* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

## Problems Experienced and how they were solved:

* Background image sizing issues - I became attached to a stock image I found, which was not made for the trivia quiz game since the form would be lengthy after a user clicks the "Start" button.

* Lots of time was spent manipulating the CSS styling and different container elements in the HTML in an attempt to resolve the issue. Eventually the problem was fixed by using fixed positioning and z-index.

## Technical Approach:

* The HTML structure was built and placeholder text used for choices available to user.

* Real questions and answers were researched, developed, and implemented on the project.

* JQuery and Javascript were used.
